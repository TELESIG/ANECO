\title{ANECO: Tools for the analysis of ecoacoustic indices}
\description{
ANECO is an R package for ecoacoustic analysis that streamlines the calculation of nearly 30 acoustic indices, including underexplored metrics. It offers tools for sound pressure calibration and automated detection of rain and cicada-dominated recordings. Designed for ease of use, ANECO supports efficient workflows and encourages multi-index approaches for robust ecological interpretation.
